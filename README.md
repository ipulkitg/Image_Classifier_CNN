$Image Classifier using CNNS
In the endeavor to develop a robust image classifier for mask detection, I embarked on a comprehensive journey that encompassed multiple phases of experimentation and refinement. 
Drawing upon a rich repertoire of advanced techniques, I meticulously curated a diverse training dataset comprising thousands of images depicting individuals with and without masks. 
To ensure the model's adaptability to real-world scenarios, I employed a sophisticated array of augmentation strategies, including shear and rotation transformations, which served 
to bolster the classifier's robustness against variations in facial orientation and mask placement.

Central to the success of the project was the strategic selection and implementation of neural network architectures tailored to the task at hand. 
Leveraging the versatility of Sequential Neural Networks and the depth of pre-trained models like VGG16, I orchestrated a rigorous training regimen 
characterized by iterative fine-tuning and optimization. Through a meticulous process of hyperparameter tuning and model selection, I endeavored to 
strike a delicate balance between model complexity and generalization capability, ultimately culminating in the identification of a high-performing architecture.

The culmination of these efforts yielded a remarkably accurate classifier, boasting an impressive overall accuracy rate of 96%. This achievement not only underscored
the efficacy of the model in discerning mask-wearing behavior but also affirmed the effectiveness of the methodologies employed in tackling real-world challenges. 
As a testament to my dedication to excellence in machine learning and computer vision, this project stands as a testament to my ability to navigate the complexities
of modern data science and deliver impactful solutions that resonate with practical applications.
